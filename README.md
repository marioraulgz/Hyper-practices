# Practices

Random projects in python.
## Simple ATM (banking.py)
ATM system that connects to a sqlite database via the sqlite3 package, supports multiple accounts, implementing *Luhns Algorithm* to check if the card is valid and keeping track of all movements in a structured manner.
### Functions
- Luhn's algorithm
- Creating account
- Loggin into account
- Deposit of funds
- Withdrawal of funds
- Transfer of funds to another account

## Numeric Matrix Processor (processor.py)
Matrix operations calculator, from scratch, without any package. Prints the resulting matrix.
### Functions:
- Sanity check of all the operations
- Multiplication of matrices
- Addition of matrices
- Inverse of a matrix
- Transpose
- Determinant

## Todo List App (todo.py)
Todo list application, connecting to a database with sqlalchemy, using the datetime package to function in realtime.
### Functions:
- Show tasks for the day

- Show all tasks
- Show missed tasks
- Add tasks
- Delete tasks

## Tic Tac Toe (prueba.py)
Graphical implementation of tic tac toe (I know its pretty cliche and non worthy of your time, but it was my first "project" and I thought that the code was pretty dope at that time)
### Functions:
- Tictactoe (check the code)
